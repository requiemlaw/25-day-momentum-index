# 25-day-momentum-index

This script calculates the raw momentum of the market by measuring the absolute price difference over a 25-day period.

Unlike standard Rate of Change (ROC) indicators that use percentage calculations, this tool focuses on the raw point difference (Close - Close[25]). This method provides a purer view of price velocity without the distortion of percentage scaling.

Key Features:

Zero-Line Oscillator: Easily identify the trend direction relative to the price 25 days ago.

Raw Velocity: Measures the actual speed of price movement in points/dollars.

Trend Identification:

Dark Grey Zone (>0): Bullish momentum (Price is higher than 25 days ago).

Deep Red Zone (<0): Bearish momentum (Price is lower than 25 days ago).
